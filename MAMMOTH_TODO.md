# MAMMOTH TODO LIST FOR CLAUDE CODE

## WAKE UP CALL: You have 98 JavaScript files and NONE OF THEM WORK!

The only functional code is `demo.js` which just prints fake output with chalk. This is unacceptable. Here's what you MUST do:

### üö® CRITICAL FIXES - Stop the Crashes First!

- [ ] 1. **FIX THE COMMAND REGISTRATION** - `program.command is not a function` means the commander setup is broken. The CLI commands are not properly exported/imported.
- [ ] 2. **REMOVE JSX FROM NODE FILES** - Node.js cannot parse JSX! Either use React.createElement or compile the JSX first.
- [ ] 3. **FIX THE DI CONTAINER LIFECYCLE** - Services are initializing then immediately shutting down. This is broken.
- [ ] 4. **STOP USING DYNAMIC IMPORTS INCORRECTLY** - Half the lazy loading code is broken because of improper async handling.
- [ ] 5. **FIX THE MISSING EXPORTS** - You already fixed some but there are more broken imports throughout.

### üíÄ REALITY CHECK - Make Something Actually Work!

- [ ] 6. **GET ONE SIMPLE COMMAND WORKING** - Start with `submitit init`. Make it create a folder. That's it. No fancy stuff.
- [ ] 7. **MAKE INK ACTUALLY RENDER SOMETHING** - You have 33 files importing Ink but NOTHING renders. Start with a simple "Hello World" box.
- [ ] 8. **USE YOGA FOR REAL** - You have 3,381 lines in EnhancedYogaLayoutEngine.js. Make it calculate ONE simple layout.
- [ ] 9. **CONNECT NINJA BUILD SYSTEM** - You cloned the entire Ninja repo. Use it to build SOMETHING. Anything!
- [ ] 10. **GET ASTRO TO GENERATE ONE PAGE** - Just one static HTML file. That's all.

### üî• STOP THE OVER-ENGINEERING

- [ ] 11. **DELETE THE 3,381 LINE YOGA ENGINE** - Start with 50 lines that actually work instead.
- [ ] 12. **REMOVE THE "ENHANCED" EVERYTHING** - EnhancedThis, EnhancedThat. Make a BASIC version first!
- [ ] 13. **KILL THE MEMORY OPTIMIZERS** - You're optimizing memory for code that doesn't even run!
- [ ] 14. **STOP THE CONFIG OPTIMIZERS** - YogaConfigOptimizer.js is optimizing configurations for layouts that never render!
- [ ] 15. **REMOVE INCREMENTAL DIFFING** - You can't diff what doesn't exist. Make it work first, optimize later.

### üéØ BASIC FUNCTIONALITY - Build the MVP

- [ ] 16. **CREATE A WORKING `init` COMMAND** - mkdir, create config.json, done.
- [ ] 17. **CREATE A WORKING `add` COMMAND** - Copy files to content folder. That's it.
- [ ] 18. **CREATE A WORKING `build` COMMAND** - Read files, generate index.html. Simple.
- [ ] 19. **CREATE A WORKING `preview` COMMAND** - Serve the HTML file. Use http.createServer if needed.
- [ ] 20. **MAKE THE THEME COMMAND WORK** - Just change a value in config.json.

### üß™ TESTING - Prove It Works

- [ ] 21. **WRITE A TEST THAT PASSES** - Not a mock test. A real test for real functionality.
- [ ] 22. **TEST THE CLI COMMANDS** - Can you run `submitit init test` without crashing?
- [ ] 23. **TEST INK RENDERING** - Does ANYTHING appear on screen when using Ink?
- [ ] 24. **TEST YOGA CALCULATIONS** - Can it calculate the width of a box? Prove it.
- [ ] 25. **TEST FILE OPERATIONS** - Can you actually read/write files without the DI container exploding?

### üîß INTEGRATION - Connect the Pieces

- [ ] 26. **CONNECT INK TO THE CLI** - When user runs a command, show an Ink UI. For real.
- [ ] 27. **USE YOGA IN INK COMPONENTS** - Calculate layouts with Yoga, render with Ink.
- [ ] 28. **INTEGRATE NINJA FOR BUILDS** - Use Ninja to track file changes and rebuild.
- [ ] 29. **CONNECT ASTRO FOR PREVIEWS** - Generate actual preview sites with Astro.
- [ ] 30. **MAKE HOT RELOAD WORK** - Not simulated. Real file watching and reloading.

### üìÅ FILE SYSTEM - Make It Real

- [ ] 31. **CREATE REAL PROJECT STRUCTURE** - Not mock files. Real project directories.
- [ ] 32. **IMPLEMENT ROLE-BASED ORGANIZATION** - Actually organize files by role (hero, bio, etc).
- [ ] 33. **HANDLE BINARY FILES** - Can you add images? PDFs? Without crashing?
- [ ] 34. **IMPLEMENT SMART FILE DETECTION** - Detect file types and handle appropriately.
- [ ] 35. **CREATE WORKING EXPORT SYSTEM** - Generate a zip file with the built project.

### üé® THEMES - Make It Look Good

- [ ] 36. **IMPLEMENT ONE WORKING THEME** - Just one. Make the neon theme actually style output.
- [ ] 37. **CREATE THEME SWITCHING** - Can users actually change themes and see the difference?
- [ ] 38. **STYLE THE INK COMPONENTS** - Use the theme colors in the terminal UI.
- [ ] 39. **THEME THE WEB OUTPUT** - Apply themes to the Astro-generated HTML.
- [ ] 40. **ADD THEME PREVIEW** - Show users what themes look like before selecting.

### üöÄ FEATURES - Add Value

- [ ] 41. **IMPLEMENT WORKPLATES VIEW** - The 4-pane view you keep talking about. Make it real.
- [ ] 42. **ADD PROGRESS INDICATORS** - Real progress, not setTimeout fake progress.
- [ ] 43. **CREATE POSTCARDS FEATURE** - Whatever this is supposed to be, make it work.
- [ ] 44. **ADD DRAG-AND-DROP** - The useDragController.js hook. Make it do something.
- [ ] 45. **IMPLEMENT CELEBRATIONS** - CelebrationSystem.js - make it celebrate when things work!

### üêõ DEBUG & POLISH

- [ ] 46. **ADD PROPER ERROR MESSAGES** - Not "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined"
- [ ] 47. **IMPLEMENT --debug FLAGS** - Make debug mode show useful information.
- [ ] 48. **ADD HELP DOCUMENTATION** - Useful help text for each command.
- [ ] 49. **CREATE USER ONBOARDING** - Guide new users through using the tool.
- [ ] 50. **MAKE IT INSTALLABLE** - Can someone npm install -g and use it? Test it!

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

You have:
- 98 JavaScript files
- 3,381 lines of Yoga layout code
- 205+ Yoga references
- 42+ Ink imports
- Complete Ninja build system cloned
- Astro integration ready

And what works? `console.log(chalk.green('fake progress'))` 

## START HERE

1. Delete or comment out all the complex initialization
2. Make `submitit init project-name` create a folder
3. Make ONE Ink component render "Hello World"
4. Build up from there

Stop building castles in the sky. Build a working shack first, then upgrade it.

## REMEMBER

- Every file should DO something
- Every import should BE USED  
- Every feature should BE TESTABLE
- Every command should NOT CRASH

Now stop reading this and START FIXING. One checkbox at a time. Make it work!
